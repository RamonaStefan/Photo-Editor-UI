<p> 
   The contrast of an image is determined by the width of the distribution of the color values belonging to the image. If all color values are grouped together 
   in a very tight distribution, the details in the image will tend to be washed <br>
   out and the overall appearance of the image will tend toward some shade of gray. The shade will depend on the location of the grouping between the extremes 
   of 0 and 255. <br>
   At the extremes, if the color values are closely grouped near zero, the colors will range from black to dark gray.If the color values are grouped near 255, 
   the colors will range from very light gray to white. <br>
   The contrast of the image can be increased by increasing the width of the distribution of the color values. The contrast can be decreased by decreasing the 
   width of the distribution.<br>
   A straightforward way to change the width of the distribution with, or without changing the general location of the distribution consists of the following steps: <br>
   - Calculate the mean of all the color values. <br>
   - Subtract the mean from every color value, causing the mean value to be shifted to zero. <br>
   - Multiply every color value by the same scale factor <br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* If the scale factor is greater than 1.0, the width of the distribution will be increased. <br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* If the scale factor is less than 1.0, the width of the distribution will be decreased. <br>
   - Add the original mean value to every color value to restore the distribution to its original location or to move it to a new location. <br>
   A straightforward way to change the location of the distribution is to add (or subtract) the same constant to every color value. <br>
   After performing these operations, it is important to make certain that all color values fall within the range of an unsigned byte(0 - 255). A simple way to do
   this is to simply clip the color values at those two limits if they fall outside the limits. <br>
   Slipping values to the limits will tend to narrow the distribution and to create a spike in the distribution at the value of the limit. <br>
   The user can modify the contrast of the processed image by entering new values, named multiplicative factors.The initial value is 1.  For this value, the processed 
   image should be identical to the new image.<br>
   To increase the contrast, the user should type a value greater than 1.<br>
   To decrease the contrast, the user should type a value less than 1.</p>
